        <b>Major additions</b>\n\n

        <b><i>Daily wallpaper changer</i></b>\n
        It\'s finally here! This was the most requested feature, I appreciate your patience.

        <b><i>Launcher widget</i></b>\n
        • A launcher widget for APOD Gallery has been implemented.\n
        • Swipe through all of the images you\'ve saved from <b>APOD Gallery</b> (stored in /sdcard/APOD/).\n

        • Fix HTTPS issue on older devices and reinstate support for pre-Lollipop devices\n
        • Display proper images titles for dates before 1998\n
        • Adjust toolbar text colours on older devices\n
        • Update libraries\n

        • Can be enabled/disabled in settings menu\n
        • Checks if a new image is available every day and set the current day\'s featured image as your phone\'s wallpaper\n
        • Automatically runs on boot, if enabled\n
        • Wallpaper will not be changed if the current day\'s featured content is not picture (video, website, etc.)\n
        • Warning: This may use up your mobile data connection. Images are usually less than 1 megabyte.\n
        • Warning: Task killers and memory management apps may conflict with the wallpaper changer task. I suggest whitelisting <b>APOD Gallery</b> if you want to enable this feature.\n
        • Currently, only standard definition images can be set as wallpaper\n\n
