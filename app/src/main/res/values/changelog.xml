    <string name="wallpaper_summary">The service checks if a new image is available every day and set the current day\'s featured image as your phone\'s wallpaper.\n\n
        If enabled, it will automatically run on boot.
        The wallpaper is not changed if the current day\'s featured content is not a picture.\n\n

        <b>Warning</b>: This may use your mobile data connection. Images are usually less than 1 megabyte.\n
        <b>Warning</b>: Task killers and memory management apps may conflict with the wallpaper changer task. I suggest whitelisting APOD Gallery if you want to enable this feature.\n
